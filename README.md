Welcome to my homelab repository! This is my ever-evolving personal infrastructure, designed to sharpen my DevSecOps skills, experiment with new technologies, and serve as a "living resume." If you're interested in self-hosting, Kubernetes, or home server setups, you're in the right place!


## 🤔 Why?

I built this homelab for several reasons:
- **Hands-on Learning:** I've tried wathing tutoriasl, reading , you name it. I learn best by doing. By having a goals and working towrads that goal. The best way to learn is by doing. I use my lab to experiment with Kubernetes, automation, and security practices.
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Everything is managed with declarative configurations and automation tools.
- **Career Growth:** This homelab is a testament to my ability to design, deploy, and maintain infrastructure in a real-world environment.


## 🚀 Is Kubernetes Overkill for a Homelab?

Some may argue that Kubernetes is excessive for a homelab, but I see it as an opportunity:
- **Real-World Experience:** Many enterprises run Kubernetes in production. Why not gain hands-on experience at home?
- **Scalability & Flexibility:** Even in a homelab, container orchestration simplifies deployments, updates, and scaling.
- **Networking & Security Practice:** Running K8s helps me experiment with service meshes, ingress controllers, and security hardening.

While K8s has a learning curve, I believe the benefits outweigh the complexity, making it a valuable addition to my homelab.


## 🔧 Hardware

My homelab runs on a mix of physical and virtual machines. Here’s a breakdown of my setup:

| Component                 | Processor          | Memory       | Storage       |
|---------------------------|--------------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Beelink EQ13 Pro Mini PC** | Intel Core i9 12900HK | 16GB | 512GB  |
| **Beelink GTi12 Mini PC**  | Intel Alder Lake- N200 | 64GB   | 1TB  |


As I expand my homelab, I continue refining my hardware choices for performance, efficiency, and reliability.

## 🏗️ Architecture

My homelab architecture is centered around:
- **Kubernetes Cluster** (Deployed via kubeadm)
- **Docker & Containerized Services**
- **Traefik Reverse Proxy** for ingress routing
- **Monitoring & Logging Stack** (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki)
- **CI/CD Pipelines** for automated deployments
- **Self-Hosted Apps** like Plex, Dashy, and more

A detailed diagram of my architecture will be added soon!
