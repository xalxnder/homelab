Welcome to my homelab repository! This is my ever-evolving personal infrastructure, designed to sharpen my DevSecOps skills, experiment with new technologies, and serve as a "living resume." If you're interested in self-hosting, Kubernetes, or home server setups, you're in the right place!

## 🤔 Why?

I built this homelab for several reasons:
- **Hands-on Learning:** The best way to learn is by doing. I use my lab to experiment with Kubernetes, automation, and security practices.
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Everything is managed with declarative configurations and automation tools.
- **Self-Hosting:** I enjoy running my own services, from media servers to internal tools, with full control over my data.
- **Career Growth:** This homelab is a testament to my ability to design, deploy, and maintain infrastructure in a real-world environment.

## 🚀 Is Kubernetes Overkill for a Homelab?

Some may argue that Kubernetes is excessive for a homelab, but I see it as an opportunity:
- **Real-World Experience:** Many enterprises run Kubernetes in production. Why not gain hands-on experience at home?
- **Scalability & Flexibility:** Even in a homelab, container orchestration simplifies deployments, updates, and scaling.
- **Networking & Security Practice:** Running K8s helps me experiment with service meshes, ingress controllers, and security hardening.

While K8s has a learning curve, I believe the benefits outweigh the complexity, making it a valuable addition to my homelab.

## 🔧 Hardware

My homelab runs on a mix of physical and virtual machines. Here’s a breakdown of my setup:

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Beelink Mini PC** | Running Rocky Linux 9, hosting various services |
| **Proxmox Server** | Virtualization backbone for running VMs and containers |
| **Networking** | Tailscale for secure remote access, Traefik for reverse proxy |
| **Storage** | Self-hosted NAS for persistent data |

As I expand my homelab, I continue refining my hardware choices for performance, efficiency, and reliability.

## 🏗️ Architecture

My homelab architecture is centered around:
- **Kubernetes Cluster** (Deployed via kubeadm)
- **Docker & Containerized Services**
- **Traefik Reverse Proxy** for ingress routing
- **Monitoring & Logging Stack** (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki)
- **CI/CD Pipelines** for automated deployments
- **Self-Hosted Apps** like Plex, Dashy, and more

A detailed diagram of my architecture will be added soon!
